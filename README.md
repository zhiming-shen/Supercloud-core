Check out documents/quick\_start.txt for installation instructions. 

Due to the large code base of the Supercloud project, this repository only contains installation scripts. The actual code of xen-blanket kernel and hypervisor will be downloaded automatically by the script.

If you just need Xen-Blanket, check out Xen-Blanket-AGN (https://github.com/zhiming-shen/Xen-Blanket-AGN).
